        A Mathe Magician is a mathematician who is also a magician. The term  &quot;mathemagic&quot;
        is believed to have been introduced by Royal Vale Heath with his 1933 book
        &quot;Mathemagic&quot;. The name &quot; mathemagician&quot; was probably first applied to
        Martin Gardner, but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians, including
        Arthur T. Benjamin, Persi Diaconis, and Colm Mulcahy. Diaconis has suggested that the reason
        so many mathematicians are magicians is that &quot;inventing a magic trick and inventing a
        theorem are very similar activities.&quot;

        Mathe Magician is a neologism, specifically a portmanteau, that combines mathematician and
        magician. A great number of self-working mentalism tricks rely on mathematical principles.
        Max Maven often utilizes this type of magic in his performance. The Mathemagician is the
        name of a character in the 1961 children&apos;s book The Phantom Tollbooth. He is the ruler
        of Digitopolis, the kingdom of mathematics.
